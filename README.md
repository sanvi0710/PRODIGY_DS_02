# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis - EDA & Data Cleaning

This repository contains a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning workflow on the famous **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle. This project is part of the internship task for **Prodigy Infotech - Task 02**.

---

## 📂 Files Included

- `Prodigy_Infotech_task_02.ipynb` – Google Colab notebook with full EDA and data cleaning steps
- `train.csv`, `test.csv` – Standard Titanic datasets
- `gender_submission.csv` – Sample submission format from Kaggle

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Load and explore Titanic dataset
- Clean missing and irrelevant data
- Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
- Identify meaningful patterns and correlations in the dataset

---

## 📊 Key Features

- Missing value handling (Age, Embarked)
- Feature transformations (`Sex`, `Embarked` → numeric)
- Visualizations using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**
- Insights on:
  - Gender and survival
  - Class and fare distribution
  - Age impact on survival
  - Port of embarkation analysis
  - Correlation matrix of numerical features

---

## 📌 Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

---

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

- Countplots for survival by gender and class
- Age and fare distribution histograms
- Heatmap of correlation matrix
- Catplot for combined effect of sex and class

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This notebook reveals clear patterns in Titanic survival data:
- Women and children had higher survival rates
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive
- Passengers who paid higher fares had better survival odds
